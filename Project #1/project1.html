	<h1>My favourite book</h1>
	<div> <!-- This is the section of the code where I talk about the book -->
		<p>Books are very good friends that never leave your side. I really enjoy reading books. They have the power to travel through all over the world without moving from place. In addition books are als helping to enhance our imagination. My parents and teachers always encouraged me to read a book. They taught me how important is to read a book</p>
		<p>I have read so many books by my favourite is Harry Potter. The author of this book is J.K Rowling. These books are about the wizarding world. Harry Potter series contains seven books. My favorite book from the series is the <b>Sorcerer's Stone</b></p>
		<p> The series contains a lot of lessons for people to learn. The book teaches us about the importance of friendship. It also teaches us that no one is perfect in this world. Everyone has good and also evil inside them. The most flawed characers of this series like Snape has goodnes inside him. Similarly, how the nicest ones' character like Dubledore has some of the bad traits.
		So it all depends on who you wish to be. The book changed my perspective towards the people in general and made me more considerate.</p>
		<p>In last, these books taught me the true meaning of hope. It taught me that there is light at the end of the tunnel and these are some of the most important and interesting things which I learned from Harry Potter.</p>
